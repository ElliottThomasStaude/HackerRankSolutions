# HackerRankSolutions
A series of code snippets used in solving problems for challenges presented by the HackerRank community.

All problems and transcripts of problems are taken directly from the presented content found, during or in the proximity of the time where the relevant files are pushed to this repository, at https://www.hackerrank.com; for none of these, other than the contributed executable code, can the author take credit.

This repository is meant to serve as exemplary evidence of the author's coding style and principles, within certain limitations imposed by the problem domain (such as restricting Java code solutions to the single class "Solution", despite the creation of other classes often being appropriate for use in some problems).
