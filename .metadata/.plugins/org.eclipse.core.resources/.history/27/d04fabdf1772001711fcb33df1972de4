Transcript of problem:

You are a waiter at a party. There are N stacked plates on pile A_0. Each plate has a number written on it. Then there will be Q iterations. In i-th iteration, you start picking up the plates in A_(i-1) from the top one by one and check whether the number on the plate is divisible by the i-th prime. If the number is divisible, you stack that plate on pile B_i. Otherwise, you stack that plate on pile A_i. After Q iterations, plate can only be on pile B_1, B_2, ..., B_Q, A_Q. Output numbers on these plates from the top to bottom of each piles in order of B_1, B_2, ..., B_Q, A_Q.

-- Input Format

The first line contains two space separated integers, N and Q.
The next line contains N space separated integers representing the initial pile of plates, i.e., A_0. The leftmost value represents the bottom plate of the pile.

-- Constraints

1 <= N <= 5 x 10^4
2 <= number_i <= 10^4
1 <= Q <= 1200

-- Output Format

Output N lines. Each line contains a number written on the plate. Printing should be done in the order defined above.
