Transcript of problem:

You have an empty sequence, and you will be given N queries. Each query is one of these three types:

1 x -Push the element x into the stack.
2   -Delete the element present at the top of the stack.
3   -Print the maximum element in the stack.

-- Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer, N. The next N lines each contain an above mentioned query. (It is guaranteed that each query is valid.)

-- Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= x <= 10^9
1 <= type <= 3

-- Output format

For each type 3 query, print the maximum element in the stack on a new line.
