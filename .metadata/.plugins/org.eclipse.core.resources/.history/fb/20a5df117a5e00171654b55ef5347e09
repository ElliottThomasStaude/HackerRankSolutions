Transcript of problem:

Consider an n-integer sequence, A = {a_0, a_1, ..., a_(n-1)}. We perform a query on A by using an integer, d, to calculate the result of the following expression:

min(max(a_j))
0 <= i <= n-d
i <= j <= i+d

In other words, if we let m_i = max(a_i, a_(i+1), a_(i+2), ..., a_(i+d-1)), then you need to calculate min(m_0, m_1, ..., m_(n-d)).

Given A and q queries (each query consists of an integer, d), print the result of each query on a new line.

-- Input Format

The first line consists of two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n and q.
The second line consists of n space-separated integers describing the respective values of a_0, a_1, ..., a_(n-1).
Each of the q subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting the value of d for that query.

-- Constraints

1 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= a_i < 10^6
1 <= q <= 100
1 <= d <= n

-- Output Format

For each query, print an integer denoting the query's answer on a new line. After completing all the queries, you should have printed q lines.
